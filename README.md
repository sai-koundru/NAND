# ðŸ”Œ NAND Gate in Verilog

This project implements a basic **2-input NAND gate** in Verilog. A NAND (Not AND) gate is a fundamental building block in digital logic design and is **functionally complete**, meaning all other logic gates can be derived from it.

---

## ðŸ§  Logic Function

The NAND gate outputs `0` **only** when both inputs are `1`; otherwise, it outputs `1`.

| A | B | A NAND B |
|---|---|----------|
| 0 | 0 |    1     |
| 0 | 1 |    1     |
| 1 | 0 |    1     |
| 1 | 1 |    0     |
